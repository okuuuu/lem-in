## Lem-in

### Description

This project is meant to write a simplified digital version of an [ant farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms). The program reads data describing the ants and the colony from a file passed in the arguments. The available paths are being found in the order of increasing length using BFS algorithm. Upon successfully finding the quickest path, lem-in will display the content of the file passed as argument and each move the ants make from room to room.

**The current project is 80% complete.**
